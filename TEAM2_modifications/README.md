Module descriptors

DTLN-aec-main/run_aec.py - Implements the AEC component. The authors’ original process_audio() function was adapted to input and output arrays instead of wav files to facilitate integration with the rest of the audio pipeline.

DTLN-master/run_evaluation.py - Implements the SE component. Similar to the AEC component, the authors’ original process_file() function was adapted to input and output arrays instead of wav files to facilitate integration with the rest of the audio pipeline.

source_sep.py - Implements the BSS component.

audio_pipeline.py - Implements the ASR component. Integrates all system components into a customisable AudioPipeline class. AudioPipeline objects have an inference method that takes audio arrays as inputs and, after running them through each component in the specified pipeline, outputs processed audio arrays and predicted transcripts.

process_transcripts.py - Preprocesses ground-truth transcripts as described above. Postprocesses predicted transcripts generated by the ASR component to facilitate WER computation.

verbal_fillers.txt - A list of filler words which process_transcripts.py filters from the ground truth and predicted transcripts before WER is computed.

load_kroto_data.py - Preprocesses ground-truth audio and loads audio data for use in experiments.

experiments.py - Defines a template “Experiment” class with methods for initialising audio pipelines according to this study’s specifications (e.g. the order of different speech components), loading the preprocessed dataset, running inference and saving the output arrays and transcripts for computing metrics.

run_experiments.py - Short sample script that imports experiments.py to set up and then run an experiment.

experiment_patching.py - This is a supplementary module that is retained in our repository for completeness. It had been created to remedy an earlier technical error we identified with the audio_pipeline.py module relating to the SE component. It reruns our RQ1 experiment with respect to the three conditions involving this component. We have since then updated audio_pipeline.py so that the ordinary approach of using run_experiments.py would produce the same final experiment outputs as running this module. 

compute_metrics.py - Parses the output directories of an experiment; retrieves the corresponding ground truth audio and transcripts in order to compute (a) signal metrics such as PESQ and STOI; and (b) WER. The computed metrics w.r.t. each prediction are saved into a single csv for statistical analysis 

statistical_testing.py - Parses csv of experiment results and analyses for statistical significance 

testing_CI.py - Parses csv of experiment results and computes confidence intervals

TEAM2_utils.py - Stores auxiliary functions used by various modules in our system
