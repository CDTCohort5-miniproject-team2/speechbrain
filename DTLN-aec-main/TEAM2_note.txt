*_mic.wav = the near-end microphone signals (i.e. wall_mic) and *_lpb.wav = the far-end microphone or loopback signals (i.e. close-talk).

FYI - I included the AEC repo here explicitly for convenience,
since we would want to integrate this into our of our pipeline

NOTE: pip install the speechbrain_plus_requirements.txt (I created this from the initial_requirements.txt
and removing the module (for now, only numpy) that we have already installed when initialising speechbrain).
I also removed the following because of error on my computer (which I am figuring a workaround for) -
 - tensorflow==2.3.1
 - grpcio==1.33.1
- THIS IS STILL A WORK-IN-PROGRESS AND YOU MAY NEED TO FURTHER TAILOR TO YOUR VENV

To get this AEC running, I separately pip installed tensorflow 2.5.1; and upgraded protobuf
using "pip install --upgrade protobuf"

Paul: I needed to also seperately pip install h5py.
